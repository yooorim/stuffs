# Pip / PIL module Error

I wanted to make a automation script to crop multiple (more than 100 image) with python.

But terminal showed me those Error.

So I spend 2 hours to solve it but failed, and Seungjoon solved the p 

```python
Error: No available formula or cask with the name "pip".
pip is part of the python formula:
```

---

**Reason**: Anaconda is a environment. But I tried to install something again and again.
So he uninstalled anaconda3 and loaded the Path that is turned when Terminal is loading(Using vi)

**Learn:** understand about Virtual Environments more clearly before I use it.

---

Error situation: No pip was found

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/macintosh/opt/**anaconda3**/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
    from pip._internal.cli.main import main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip'
```

anaconda is the main problem

```python
vi ~/.bash_profile
```

remove anaconda blabla.

**:wq!**  for exit

```python
conda install anaconda-clean
anaconda-clean --yes

sudo rm -rf /anaconda3
```

remove anaconda3

let's reinstall pip

```python
**curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py**

The problemaic part is,

```python
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use 窶馬o-warn-script-location.
  WARNING: The script wheel is installed in '/Users/macintosh/Library/Python/2.7/bin' which is not on PATH.

```

so, go into vi again

```python
vi ~/.bash_profile

**export PATH=$PATH:/Users/macintosh/Library/Python/2.7/bin**
```

put the second line

**:wq!**  for exit

and turn on the terminal again.

```python
pip install pillow
```

Problem solved!
